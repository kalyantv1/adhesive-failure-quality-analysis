# Quality Improvement Analysis: Adhesive Failure in Assembly

This repository documents a quality improvement project analyzing adhesive bonding failures between Part A and Part B using an affinity diagram approach.

## Problem overview

Customer returns showed that the adhesive joint between Part A and Part B was failing in the field, impacting customer satisfaction, warranty costs, and brand reputation. A cross‑functional team brainstormed ten potential root causes that needed to be organized for deeper analysis and corrective action planning.

## Methodology

- Used an affinity diagram (KJ Method) to group ten brainstormed causes into logical categories.  
- Applied five predefined themes: Machine, Personnel, Support, Vendor, and Design.  
- Facilitated input from production, quality, engineering, and procurement stakeholders to ensure diverse perspectives.

## Key findings

- Machine and Personnel categories each accounted for 30% of identified potential causes, indicating both equipment/control and human‑factor issues.  
- Design‑related causes represented 20% of the list, suggesting that product or adhesive design choices may contribute to failures.  
- Support and Vendor issues each represented 10% of items, pointing to documentation/specification risks and potential supplier quality concerns.

## Interpretation

- Machine issues (e.g., incorrect programs, poor calibration, incorrect setups) point toward systemic problems in automated adhesive application that can generate batch‑level defects.  
- Personnel issues (training gaps, unclear instructions, capability concerns) highlight the need for standardized training and clearer work instructions.  
- Design, Support, and Vendor categories suggest parallel workstreams: design review, documentation and part‑number checks, and supplier evaluation.

## Skills and tools demonstrated

- Quality management and root‑cause structuring using affinity diagrams.  
- Cross‑functional collaboration (production, quality, engineering, procurement).  
- Data organization and basic quantitative breakdown of qualitative causes (counts and percentages by category).
